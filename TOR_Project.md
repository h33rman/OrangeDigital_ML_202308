## Project Title: Machine Learning System for Scanning, Transcribing, and Classifying Library Books

### 1. Background:

In an effort to digitize our library and improve user experience, we aim to develop a system capable of scanning, transcribing, and classifying all books within the library. The end goal is to have a digital database that includes the title, author, and a classified summary of each book in the library.

### 2. Objectives:

The project is split into several components:

- **Scanning and Transcription**: Develop a system capable of scanning the physical books, transcribing the relevant information (including title, author, and book summary), and storing this information in a digital database.
  
- **Classification**: Develop a machine learning model that can classify the books based on their summaries into different genres or topics.
  
- **Database Creation**: Organize the collected data into a structured format that allows for efficient querying and data retrieval.

### 3. Methodology:

The project will involve several stages:

- **Data Collection**: Gather data to train our machine learning models. This includes text classification datasets, OCR datasets, and book data.

- **Model Development**: Develop machine learning models for the tasks of OCR and text classification. Use appropriate machine learning libraries and tools, including but not limited to pytesseract, spaCy, NLTK, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

- **Database Design**: Design a database schema that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of the book data. 

- **System Integration**: Integrate the various components of the project into a cohesive system.

### 4. Expected Outcomes:

- A digitized database containing the title, author, and classified summary of each book in the library.
- A system that can efficiently scan new books and add their information to the database.
  
### 5. Timeframe:


### 6. Resources:

The project team will consist of [number of people], including machine learning specialists, data scientists, and database administrators. The project will require access to various resources, including machine learning and OCR software tools, a database server, and a collection of digital books for testing.

### 7. Review:

The progress of the project will be reviewed bi-weekly. Adjustments will be made as necessary to ensure that the project is on track to meet its objectives within the designated timeframe.
